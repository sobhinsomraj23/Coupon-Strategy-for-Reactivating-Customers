Problem statement:                                                                                                                                                                  
The company aims to re-engage inactive customers who have previously made purchases through their offline store by offering them online shopping coupons. The goal is to incentivize these customers to start shopping online, thereby boosting online sales.

Challenge:                                                                                                                                                                          
The primary limitation is that the company has a budget of only $1000 to spend on these coupons. This requires a strategic allocation of the budget to maximize the reactivation of inactive customers while staying within the financial constraint.

Key Questions:
